  <h2>Now that you know some random things about me, I can tell you a bit more about where I'm from, what I do, and what my interests are.</h2>
  <h3>I am a former public health professional from Seattle, Washington with 6+ years in customer service who made the jump to software development to expand my skill set. My passion has always been to drive business through client and patient experience. I'm looking to apply development skills to use an innovative, user-centric approach to solve problems. I believe that problem solving should be organic, information-based, and iterative. My experience in qualitative research academically and globally remains one of my strongest assets. In my spare time, you'll find me cooking, at a live comedy show, at a concert, or ofcourse, spending time with my dogs. As a future jobseeker, my intention is to create a portfolio that is appealing to employers in the tech industry.</h2>
